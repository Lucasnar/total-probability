## Goal

The goal of this repository is to store some work I had to do in the Statistics class.

## PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md

The file `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` contains the statistics problem statement I created. This problem was used in the competition part of the second Elixir Day at Quero Education. :D
It is written in Portuguese since the competitions was based in Brazil.

## chocolate.exs

A solution to the problem I created in Elixir. It's not amazing, but... you know, you gotta be functional sometimes. (intended |> pun) # true

## chocolate.cpp

A solution to the problem I created in C/C++, which is generally my first choice when it comes to solving algorithmic problems.
